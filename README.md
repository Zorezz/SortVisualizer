# Sorting Visualizer
This is a project where I wanted to use C and SDL2 to visualize sorting
algorithms similar to what I have seen in videos on youtube and it also
allows me to practice implementing the sorting algorithms.

# Building
This project requires SDL2 so make sure to install the library first.

`
git clone https://github.com/Zorezz/SortVisualizer.git
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
`
